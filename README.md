# oss_report

This little app allows you to visualize the activity of a GitHub user. It's that simple.

## From source

Grab the repo

```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/jameslamb/oss_report.git
cd oss_report
```

Kick up the app

```
# Build
docker build -t oss_report:$(cat VERSION) -f Dockerfile-app .

# Run
docker run -p 5090:5090 -d oss_report:$(cat VERSION)
```

## From dockerhub

Pull and run the container from dockerhub.

```{bash}
docker run -p 5090:5090 -d jameslamb/oss_report:0.0.1
```

## Use the service

Navigate to `localhost:5090` in your browser to view the app!

You can hit the `/api/events` endpoint to get JSON data with all the relevant activity a user took in the last 90 days.

```
curl -XGET http://localhost:5090/api/events?user=jameslamb
```

## Pushing to Container Registry

If, for whatever reason, you want to build and push a version of this to your own space in a container registry like Dockerhub, you can use `publish.sh`.

```{bash}
./publish.sh your_repository_name
```

Note that this will tag the container with the version number stored in `VERSION`.

## Authentication with the Github API

Note that this service hits the Github API. This API's [rate limit policy](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting) states that unauthenticated requests are limited (by IP address) to 60 requests per hour. Authenticated requests are limited to 5000 an hour.

As of now, this app has no formal support for injecting application secrets into an instance of this service. That means that it can only make 60 requests an hour.

Such is life.
